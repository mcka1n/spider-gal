# Rails Server Template

## Overview

This is a template chef structure for deploying Rails applications. The example template and Vagrantfile provide a single VM configuration which works out of the box and can be used to deploy any Rails 3.x or 4.x application. It's most suitable as a drop in Heroku replacement for low traffic apps.

The configuration is also flexible enough to be adapted to multi machine setups.

## Documentation

This is the example code which section one of the book "Reliably Deploying Rails Applications" available from leanpub here <https://leanpub.com/deploying_rails_applications> is based.

If you run into any issues using the template provided here, please open a Github issue, I actively monitor these and will respond as quickly as possible.
